<p>The Secret Service has its scandals. For a while the Secret Service has been sued by multiple African-American agents for discrimination <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/justice-secret-side-secret-service-89899">(Newsweek Staff, 2008)</a>. Multiple experienced African-American agents are being passed up on promotions for other white officers with less experience than them. While the culture of Secret Service has a “good ole boy” feel, it doesn’t help that racist e-mails have been passed around and even blunt racism, such as by covering up a black agents face with paper in the Secret Service calendar that hangs in agent’s cubicles <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/justice-secret-side-secret-service-89899">(Newsweek Staff, 2008)</a>. The Secret Service is very resilient on giving over any of this evidence to the courts and believe that they are handling the very few in their opinion discrimination cases. Although FBI has dealt with their discrimination with procedures late in the 90’s the Secret Service drags its feet to implement anything <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/justice-secret-side-secret-service-89899">(Newsweek Staff, 2008)</a>.</p>

<p>Secret Service agents aren’t too immune to the temptation of the flesh; the problem is that prostitution isn’t anywhere near to being legal <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/04/ap-secret-service-investigating-another-incident/1?csp=ip">(Jackson, 2012)</a>. There are investigations going on in the Secret Service about possible allegations of an advanced team of agents that attended a strip club, received sexual favors there, and even took escorts back to the hotel. In a report given describing the agent’s conduct with the owner and witnesses, it was reported the officers were drunk and bragging that they do this kind of stuff all the time <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/04/ap-secret-service-investigating-another-incident/1?csp=ip">(Jackson, 2012)</a>. The incident is still being investigated; a solution by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that the Secret Service should just hire more women <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/04/ap-secret-service-investigating-another-incident/1?csp=ip">(Jackson, 2012)</a>.</p>

<p>A disagreement on how much money a Secret Service agent should pay a prostitute has landed over 10 agents in boiling water <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/world/americas/3-in-prostitution-scandal-being-forced-out-of-secret-service-officials-say.html?src=un&feedurl=http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/world/americas/index.jsonp&_r=0">(Schmidt, 2012)</a>. Secret Service fears that this might go deeper in the agency. This all stems from an advanced team sent to Colombia to get ready for the arrival of President Obama.  A supervisor has been fired, while two agents have resigned and eight are still under investigation <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/world/americas/3-in-prostitution-scandal-being-forced-out-of-secret-service-officials-say.html?src=un&feedurl=http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/world/americas/index.jsonp&_r=0">(Schmidt, 2012)</a>. The Secret Service is doing everything in their power to find out the truth, including lie detectors. United States officials congratulate the Secret Service in such swift action into investigating the allegations <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/world/americas/3-in-prostitution-scandal-being-forced-out-of-secret-service-officials-say.html?src=un&feedurl=http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/world/americas/index.jsonp&_r=0">(Schmidt, 2012)</a>. Prostitution scandals raise fear of possible leaks of information and jeopardizing the country and the President <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/world/americas/3-in-prostitution-scandal-being-forced-out-of-secret-service-officials-say.html?src=un&feedurl=http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/world/americas/index.jsonp&_r=0">(Schmidt, 2012)</a>.</p>

<p>The Secret Service can’t seem to have a break from scandals, even though the Colombia scandal cost multiple officers and even the head of the agency resigned. Sadly, a dark mark came from the Netherlands where an agent was found in the hallway of his hotel passed out from drinking.  Three agents were sent back for disciplinary reasons <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/08/politics/secret-service-internal-changes/">
(Acosta, 2014)</a>. It seems that alcohol might be a danger for the Secret Service, especially after an agent was “involved in a traffic accident in Florida and alcohol use was suspected” <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/08/politics/secret-service-internal-changes/">
(Acosta, 2014)</a>. Right now, the Secret Service has not changed any rules involving alcohol consumption <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/08/politics/secret-service-internal-changes/">
