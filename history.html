            <p>The United States Secret Service was formed out of the need to fight a ramped problem in the newly formed United States. More than a third of America’s currency was counterfeit all the way up to President Lincoln's time in office <a href="http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/kids/inside/html/spring98-2.html">(National Archives and Records Administration)</a>. Taking advice from Secretary of Treasury Hugh McCulloch, on July 5, 1865 the United States Secret Service was formed with Chief William P. Wood as Director <a href="http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/kids/inside/html/spring98-2.html">(National Archives and Records Administration)</a>. The Secret Service was placed under Department of Treasury for 138 years, but in 2003 the Secret Service was transferred over to Department of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL34603.pdf">(Reese, 2013)</a>. Chief Wood went to quick work in the Secret Service, in “his first year he closed more than 200 counterfeiting plants” <a href="http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/kids/inside/html/spring98-2.html">(National Archives and Records Administration)</a>. In 1967, Congress gave power to investigate anyone who could possibly be counterfeiting in the hands of the Secret Service. Congress then decided in 1977 to make counterfeiting of coins, gold and silver bars illegal <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/history.shtml">(United States Secret Service, 2014)</a>. The Secret Service kept only one mission for a couple of years and that was to investigate counterfeiting, but we all know them as the President protection detail although this didn’t start until 1901.</p>
            <p>After three assassinations: President Lincoln, President Garfield and President McKinley in 1901, it was decided to officially hand over Presidential protection detail to the Secret Service. It took 36 years and even with light security, before congress decided that the President needed protection.  The Secret Service had their mission split into two: one for protection while the other for investigation into different kinds of counterfeiting <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/history.shtml">(United States Secret Service, 2014)</a>. Over a million acres of land was returned to the United States, when the Secret Service in 1906 started to investigate the west expansion <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/history.shtml">(United States Secret Service, 2014)</a>. In a couple of years, congress would expand Secret Service protection to the Vice President, President-elect, and all members of the first family, as well as heads of other governments <a href="http://clinton2.nara.gov/WH/kids/inside/html/spring98-2.html">(National Archives and Records Administration)</a>. The Secret Service was so admired that President Roosevelt had a few agents moved over to the Department of Justice; these agents become the first to become the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/history.shtml">(United States Secret Service, 2014)</a>. The Secret Service protection detail is usually referred to as Uniformed Division, which was once Executive Protective Services and before that called White House Police in 1922 <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/history.shtml">(United States Secret Service, 2014)</a>.  Congress has changed more of the protection detail of Secret Service than the investigation side. The Special Agent Division, which is the investigation side of Secret Service, has grown to incorporate many different priorities <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL34603.pdf">(Reese, 2013)</a>.  They are in charge of “financial crimes, identity theft, counterfeiting, computer fraud, and computer based attacks on the nation’s financial, banking and telecommunications infrastructure” with so much more over the years <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL34603.pdf">(Reese, 2013)</a>. The Secret Service continues to evolve with our evolving world.</p>
