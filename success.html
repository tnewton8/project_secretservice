           <p>Bullet for a President-<p> 
<p>Thanks to incredible reaction training given by the Secret Service, agent Tim McCarthy was able to take a bullet for President Reagan. Only being President for 60 days doesn’t make Presidents any safer, on March 30th 1981 a man named John Hinckley Jr. fired six rounds, one landing in the agent and another into the President <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/he-took-a-bullet-for-reagan/">
(Crean, 2004)</a>. What was supposed to be a normal speech day in the Hilton Hotel, the President was shot on the way to the armored car. McCarthy gives thanks to his training from the Secret Service; it trained them extensively to protect the President. Unlike police and military that are trained to get themselves to cover, Secret Service agents are trained to protect the President no matter what <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/he-took-a-bullet-for-reagan/">
(Crean, 2004)</a>. Lucky for the United States, Reagan survived the assassination attempt on his life. McCarthy was very proud of how quick Reagan moved on from the event and it helped him do the same <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/he-took-a-bullet-for-reagan/">
(Crean, 2004)</a>. McCarthy visited the funeral of Reagan and even had an intimate chat with Mrs. Reagan. The country owes McCarthy thanks for his extraordinary heroism <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/he-took-a-bullet-for-reagan/">
(Crean, 2004)</a>.</p>

<p>Nets 19 Arrests- </p>
<p>The Secret Service has arrested over 19 different individuals around the country in the first big Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization. This group is partaking in identity theft, counterfeit, credit card trafficking, producing and trafficking false identification documents, plus conspiracy <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/press/GPA03-12_OpenMarket2.pdf">("U.S. Secret Service’s," 2012)</a>. This arrest has lead Secret Service to over fifty more members of the group. Working together with Las Vegas Electronic Crimes Task Force, Immigration and Customs Enforcement to combine their resources and great communication to catch all these offenders that threat personal and financial information of everyday people. The group even has a website that sells the contraband and stolen information <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/press/GPA03-12_OpenMarket2.pdf">("U.S. Secret Service’s," 2012)</a>.  Higher employees would even test the products that would be sold on the website. While doing this, offenders tried their best to hide their identities with false information and false PayPal accounts and more. The Secret Service has proven once again why the Special field agents are so important to the American people; by protecting our valuable financial identities ("U.S. Secret Service’s," 2012).</p>
